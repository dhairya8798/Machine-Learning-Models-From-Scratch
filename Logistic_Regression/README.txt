a) Implement logistic regression to classify this data (use the individual data elements, i.e. height,
weight, and age, as features). Your implementation should take different data sets as input for
learning.

b) Plot the resulting function together with the data points (using your favorite plotting program, e.g.
Matlab, Octave, ...). To generate the function for locally weighted linear regression for this data you
need to compute its value for finely spaced test data points, x, between 􀀀3 and 3.

c) Evaluate the performance of your logistic regression classifier in the same way as for Homework
1 using leve-one-out validation and compare the results with the ones for KNN and Na¨ıve Bayes
(either from your first assignment or, if you did not implement these, using an existing implementation).
Discuss what differences exist and why one method might outperform the others for this
problem.

d) Repeat the evaluation and comparison from part c) with the age feature removed. Again, discuss
what differences exist and why one method might outperform the others in this case.
